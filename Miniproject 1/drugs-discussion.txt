For all models, the standard deviation ranges close to zero. Which means the differences in the metrics’ values are negligible. This is because the models will always use the same training set, since we never introduced a new one. So, every model’s performance will resemble the way they were trained, and since they are trained with the same set, the results are similar to each other. Therefore, it explains why there is little to no changes in the accuracy and the f1-scores.
